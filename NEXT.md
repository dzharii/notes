* [ > ] [rqlite/rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite) - rqlite is an easy-to-use, lightweight, distributed relational database,
                     which uses SQLite as its storage engine. Forming a cluster is very straightforward, it gracefully handles
                     leader elections, and tolerates failures of machines,
                     including the leader. rqlite is available for Linux, OSX, and Microsoft Windows.
