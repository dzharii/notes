        [rqlite/rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite) - rqlite is an easy-to-use, lightweight, distributed relational database,
        which uses SQLite as its storage engine. Forming a cluster is very straightforward, it gracefully handles
        leader elections, and tolerates failures of machines,
        including the leader. rqlite is available for Linux, OSX, and Microsoft Windows.
