# Interview Structure

* Timebox: 25-30 minutes. Problem should be solvable in that time.
* Problem should not be complex, algorithmic, a-ha/gotcha, you get it or you don't kind of problem.  It should have some data structure organization, but not as trivial as something like "FizzBuzz".
* Tell the candidate to demonstrate OO, SOLID design in their solution. This should be re-iterated strongly if the candidate jumps in to the problem and starts solving without using these concepts.  You may need to ask the candidate to take some time and think about the design before jumping in.
* Allow candidate to use a laptop and a simple code editor.  VS Code is good because it works with many languages, is fast, easy to use, and free.  You could use [vscode-remote-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft?q=vscode-remote-try&type=&language=) to quickly clean/reset the environment.  No one likes whiteboard programming.  Be prepared to turn on/off dvorak as needed.
* Let the candidate work solo and watch as they work.
* Let the candidate solve the problem in the language they have the most expertise in.
* No tabbing away from the code editor.  No google/internet.  No running the program.
* If the candidate's using your laptop, clean up the keyboard and screen beforehand.  Turn off email/slack, close anything with sensitive information.
* Be available for questions, but let them do the problem solving. If you see errors, coach them through to finding a solution but don't directly call out the error and solution.
* Treat final code the same way you would coach someone on a PR. E.g., if they have some repeated logic, ask to DRY.
* Look for and coach unneeded mutable state, what should be public/private/static methods, var naming/clarity, separation of concerns, tradeoffs. You shouldn't be teaching these concepts, but rather assessing how fluent the candidate is in applying the concepts when pressed to.
