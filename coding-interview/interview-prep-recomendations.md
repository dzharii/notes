# Facebook

### What to Expect (min number of interviews):



### Career/Coding

You'll be meeting with an engineer who will be interested in learning about your choices and hopes for your career (trajectory), where your passions are in technology, desire for impact, why Facebook, and even possibly things you'd change/improve about Facebook. It always helps to read current news articles/blogs about Facebook for these interviews. There will also be a short coding element in this interview followed by Q&A for any questions you might have about projects, impact, etc!


### Coding (2)

Our coding interviews are similar to your initial interview. We are looking for accurate, bug-free, fast, and well-thought-out code. Your interviewers will be looking for your thought process, so be sure to provide a narrative as you go through the code. As before, you’re welcome to code in whatever language you feel most comfortable with, but choosing one that is going to assist in getting an optimal solution in the speediest and most efficient manner is key.

### Design (2)

The design interview focuses on systems - think distributed systems and APIs. You may be asked to build a feature for Facebook. Our engineer will be focusing on your ability to think through the design of a complex system, especially with regards to tradeoffs around consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. I’ve attached a document that goes more in depth.

### Software Design Prep

Often times, software systems need software components, something to store data, something to make decisions (such as business logic) and APIs or processes. Reviewing software systems design diagrams (especially SOA or distributed software systems) can be helpful for preparation.

Scaling is a critical component of software design at Microsoft. It’s important to consider scaling when diagramming and designing your software system. Be sure and research scalability concepts and technology prior to your interview such as caching, load balancing, non-relational databases, microservices and sharding.

Knowledge of distributed systems, SOA, and n-tiered software architecture is very important in answering systems design questions. If you don’t work with these concepts regularly, be sure to review them prior to your interview.

Brush up on Software design fundamentals to include object oriented design/Service Oriented Architecture fundamentals.

All interviewers will ask coding questions, be sure to ask clarifying questions before jumping into coding the solution. For an example, check out the following Channel9 segment on white boarding, the following Channel9 segment on white boarding: http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/TheChannel9Team/Gary-Daniels-and-Evan-Goldring-Mock-whiteboard-problem.

For example, you may be asked to whiteboard and hypothetically build something… such as a video streaming service… what are some important technical components you’d want to think about (from technology architecture standpoint)?

Example Design Question:

Design a video streaming service such as Netflix

* Consider aspects of an online audio platform like hosting, DRM, streaming, then subscriber management, payments, subscriptions, website to host, apps?

* Consider scaling, storage, security, etc.

* Design an Elevator / Design a Card reading system.

* Design a widget for recently viewed items.



Steps in the Systems Design Interview

1. Don’t Forget, ask clarifying questions; while the interviewer won’t try to trick you, they might be intentionally vague. It’s important to know what sort of design the interviewer is looking for, so ask questions. When asking your questions, start with the customer in mind. Who is the customer and what problem are you solving for them?

2. As you ask clarifying questions, begin writing a list of requirements on the board. This should typically be the first thing you add to the white board.

3. Once you have a good idea on the sort of problems the system you are designing are supposed to solve, begin drawing a diagram on the white board to express your ideas. A great way to do this is to draw shapes to represent different software components and data sources and then arrows connecting them to show web services, APIs, and processes connecting them.

4. Be prepared to discuss trade-offs in your design. With any software system there are multiple ways to design it. What advantages would yours have? Disadvantages? What if you were to change a component or process? Be prepared to discuss these questions.



Other Misc. Tips

* Code, code, and then code some more – practice the languages you are most comfortable.  If you know C and C++, be sure to flip through some of the books recommended above.

* Know your resume – inside and out.  Everything on your resume is fair game.  So if you noted down that you know a certain technology, you may be asked to demonstrate your knowledge.

* Revisit your CS fundamentals – flip through old CS course books, old projects from when you were at the University, or online resources.

* Practice problem solving questions – go to the internet, ask your friends and really practice.   When you practice with your friends – make sure to think out loud.  The interviewers care less about the answer and more about your problem solving and thought process.  One last tip - if an interviewer asks you a question you have heard before – let us know.  We appreciate the honesty and we typically can tell when candidates have heard of our questions.



Other Important Topics to Review Prior to Your Interview

* Be clear and concise in your stories and answers.  Make sure you frame your scenarios/situations with enough information to give the interview proper context.

* Avoid rambling and do not beat around the bush.  If you are unsure or don’t know, be honest with the interviewer but let them know you’ll give it your best try.  Ask if you are on track or going in the right direction.

* Talk about YOUR accomplishments - so speak in terms of “I did this” vs “We did this”.

* Use specific number/data points as often as possible (% growth or $X cost savings, etc.)

* It is always best to understand the current environment of the group you are interviewing with.  Be prepared to ask thoughtful questions and make some thoughtful observations about the group – products, customers, current approach, challenges etc.

* It is always a good idea to be able to articulate why you want to work at Microsoft and why for this group in particular.  We are looking for people excited about what our team is working on! J

* Review the Job Description, what are the requirements of the role.  Are you able to articulate work you have done in that space?

* We use Behavioral Based interviewing.  This means we will focus on work that you have done historically as the best predictor of the work you will do in the future.  Have examples handy of work you have done to draw upon throughout the day.


# Google

Our interviews are very technical. It will be based on Computer Science fundamentals. Here are some tips from our engineers on the main areas candidates should prepare when interviewing with Google:

1. Algorithm Complexity: You need to know Big-O. Be sure you are very comfortable with basic big-O complexity analysis

2. Coding: You will be expected to write some code in at least some of your interviews. You will be expected to know a fair amount of detail about your favorite programming language.

Check out Programming Interviews Exposed; Secrets to landing your next job by John Monagan & Noah Suojanen

3. System Design:

Distributed Systems and Parallels

Google File System
Google Bigtable
Google MapReduce



4. Sorting: Know how to sort. Don't do bubble-sort. You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and merge sort). Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.


5. Hashtables: Arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. You absolutely should know how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview.

6. Trees: Know about trees; basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented. Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.


7. Graphs: Graphs are really important at Google. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code. If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms, such as Dijkstra and A*.

8. Other data structures: You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as possible. You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means.

9. Mathematics: Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other companies because we are surrounded by counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk – the more the better.


10. Operating Systems: Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work. Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.

# Amazon

Here are some of the KEY tips I would give to help you during your interviews.

1. Before jumping into any code, answering any questions, etc. – ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. Make sure you are fully aware of what they want to see by asking questions to get more data as needed. They want to see you dive deep into what they are looking for. You will purposefully be asked ambiguous questions throughout the interview to gauge your problem solving skills.
    - Restate the problem
    - Restate any Assumptions
    - Ask Clarifying Questions
    - Start working through the problem

2. Code or script in the language you are most comfortable using. Plain and simple advice right there!

3. As you are putting your code on the board THINK OUTLOUD and walk them through the steps you are taking. It is important to show them your thought process as you answer their questions. Engage them in why you are doing what you are doing.

4. By no means do we expect you to get every single question right. They will also be gauging your ability to take coaching, come up with alternate solutions, and show your ability to analyze a problem and come up with various solutions.

### GENERAL PREP

Preparation Strategy: I suggest going down the list of our Leadership Principles, and thinking of one or more situations in the past that allows you to highlight the principle. Practice talking about the situation using the points of the STAR Method to get in the habit of thinking and talking about experiences in that framework.



[Leadership Principles](Leadership Principles)


Question Types: Most questions will aim to evaluate your problem solving skills especially in ambiguous situations.
* Case: What would you do in this scenario?
* Previous Experience: Tell me about a time when…


The STAR Method:
* Situation: Open with a brief description of the Situation and context of the story (who, what, where, when, how).
* Task: Explain the Task you had to complete highlighting any specific challenges or constraint (e.g., deadlines, costs, other issues).
* Action: Describe the specific Actions that you took to complete the task. These should highlight desirable traits without needing to state them (i.e., initiative, intelligence, dedication, leadership, understanding, etc.)
* Result: Close with the result of your efforts. Include figures to quantify the result if possible. Be provide measurable specifics where you can, and be prepared to back them up.

## TECHNICAL PREP

Please see [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) to help you prepare. You will most likely have to solve a graphing problem involving a hash map and some sort of search problem using a common data structure or algorithm like a binary search tree, divide and conquer, depth vs breadth, etc.

### Coding

* Write clean and clear code.
* Syntactically correct – no pseudo code.
* Call out your edge cases.
* If you have time add unit tests.
* Suggest practicing on pen and paper since you will be asked to code on a whiteboard.


### Data Structures

Wikipedia actually is a great resource to brush up on data structures.
Lists out the common ones and when to use them.


### Algorithms

Know how and when to use breadth-first search versus a depth-first search and what the trade-offs are.
Traversals and divide and conquer.
Time complexity.
Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms.

### GENERAL ADVICE

Be Specific: Reference data points that catalyze or justify decisions you’ve made.


Ask Questions: Ask clarifying questions. There are often ambiguous situations to deal with in the work place, and so there will be a few in your interviews. Asking questions will give you a clearer understanding of the challenges presented by the team, and gives the interviewers insight into how you dive deep on issues and solve problems. This can make a huge difference in you interviews.


Be Honest: Some interview questions may be negatively oriented. (ex. “Can you tell me about a time when you didn’t meet a deadline?”) We all have setbacks, but what’s important is how you handle them, and what you learn from them.


Take Ownership: Be mindful of appropriately using “I” vs. “we” statements. Spend more of your time speaking to your responsibilities and what you've accomplished, as oppose to what your team as a whole accomplished.


Dress: Business Casual/Casual. Amazon is a pretty comfortable environment. We’re interested in what you can accomplish more than what’s in your closet.


Here is a typical format for your interview.


Interviewer 1: System Design (Scalability and Operational Performance)
Interviewer 2: Coding (Data Structures and Algorithms)

Leadership Principles – The principles are an important aspect who we are at Amazon and the culture we maintain. As you review the 14 principles be prepared to answer a question about your work delivering on a project, challenges you might have faced, problems you had to work through, meeting a deadline, etc. You will be expected to walk us through various example in your life in which you exhibited the leadership principles. You can use this link in preparing for the questions to expect. https://careerservices.wayne.edu/behavioralinterviewinfo.pdf

Here are some possible example questions to help you further understand behavioral interviewing.

* Tell me about a time where you sought out perspectives other than your own to make a product/service/project better?
* Tell me about a time when you had to analyze facts quickly, define key issues, and respond immediately to a situation. What was the outcome?
* Give me an example of a time you used customer feedback to drive improvement or innovation. What was the situation and what action did you take?
* Tell me about a goal that you set that took a long time to achieve or that you are still working towards. How do you keep focused on the goal given the other priorities you have?
* Tell me about a time when you linked two or more problems together and identified an underlying issue? Were you able to find a solution?
* What three things you are you working on to improve your overall effectiveness?
* Give me an example of when you took an unpopular stance in a meeting with peers and your leader and you were the outlier. What was it, why did you feel strongly about it, and what did you do?
* Tell me about a time you wouldn’t compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough. What was the situation?
* Tell me about a time you made a hard decision to sacrifice short term gain for a longer term goal.
* How do you drive adoption for your vision/ideas? How do you know how well your idea or vision has been adopted by other teams or partners?
* Give a specific example highlighting one of your ideas.
* Tell me about a time when you realized you needed to have a deeper level of subject matter expertise to do your job well?

In answering the questions I would recommend using the STAR or SOAR method to tell a compelling and concise story that accurately answers the question(s) asked to you. In my own preparation for the onsite interviews I personally printed off the leadership principles and came up with 2-3 examples for each principle. When the questions were asked of me I had specific examples to share with them using the STAR or SOAR method of answering to explain each situation. Remember that using the same situation for each principle will not give us a well-rounded view of your experience.
